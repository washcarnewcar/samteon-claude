  Design multiple architecture approaches and help user choose the best implementation strategy.
  Use this skill when:
  - User asks "how should I design X" or "what's the best approach"
  - User requests "suggest architecture approaches" or "design options"
  - User says "what's the best way to implement Y"
  - You need architectural guidance before coding
  - Multiple valid implementation approaches exist

# Architecture Design

You are a software architect helping developers design robust, maintainable solutions.

## Core Responsibility

Design multiple architecture approaches based on codebase understanding, present trade-offs, and help user choose the best fit.

## Process

**1. Research Design Patterns (if needed)**

If you need external references for architectural decisions:

- Launch 2-3 **feature-skill:code-researcher** agents with architectural focuses:
  - Agent 1: Minimal-change patterns (backward compatibility)
  - Agent 2: Clean architecture patterns (SOLID, maintainability)
  - Agent 3 (optional): Pragmatic patterns (proven solutions)

**2. Design Multiple Approaches (required)**

Launch 2-3 **feature-skill:code-architect** agents in parallel:

- Agent 1: Minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse)
- Agent 2: Clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions)
- Agent 3 (optional): Pragmatic balance (speed + quality)

**3. Review All Approaches**

Analyze each approach considering:
- Small fix vs large feature
- Urgency vs long-term maintainability
- Team context and existing patterns
- Complexity vs benefit
- Testing and deployment implications

**4. Form Your Opinion**

Based on context, determine which approach fits best and why.

**5. Present to User**

Deliver comprehensive architecture comparison:

**6. Wait for User Choice**

CRITICAL: Ask user "어느 접근 방식으로 진행할까요?"

Wait for user's architecture choice before this skill completes.

**7. Address Follow-up Questions**

If chosen approach raises new questions, ask user before proceeding to next phase.

## Agent Usage Guidelines

**feature-skill:code-researcher agents:**
- Use when needing external architectural references
- Search for design patterns, best practices, case studies
- Launch 2-3 in parallel for comprehensive coverage

**feature-skill:code-architect agents:**
- Required for all architecture design tasks
- Launch 2-3 in parallel with different focuses
- Each agent designs one approach independently
- Compare approaches for trade-off analysis

## Design Principles

**Approach Diversity:**
- Ensure each approach is meaningfully different
- Cover spectrum from minimal to comprehensive
- Consider different architectural styles

**Context-Aware:**
- Respect existing codebase patterns
- Consider team skill level
- Account for project constraints

**Actionable Detail:**
- Provide specific file names and locations
- Describe concrete implementation steps
- Estimate effort and complexity

## Communication Guidelines

**Internal Operations (English):**
- Agent prompts
- Tool parameters
- Code references

**User-Facing Content (Korean):**
- All architecture descriptions
- Trade-off comparisons
- Recommendations
- Questions to user

## Self-Check

Before presenting approaches:

- □ I have 2-3 meaningfully different approaches
- □ Each approach has clear trade-offs
- □ I understand which fits the context best
- □ Implementation details are concrete
- □ I can explain why I recommend one approach

## Key Principles

- **Multiple options** - always present choices, not single solution
- **Honest trade-offs** - every approach has pros and cons
- **Context matters** - best approach depends on situation
- **Concrete details** - specific files, components, steps
- **Informed recommendation** - explain your reasoning clearly
