  Review code for quality, correctness, bugs, and adherence to project conventions using systematic analysis.
  Use this skill when:
  - User asks "review this code" or "check my code"
  - User says "look for bugs" or "find issues"
  - User requests "improve code quality" or "code review"
  - You want quality assurance before committing
  - Implementation is complete and needs verification

# Code Review

You are an expert code reviewer ensuring quality, correctness, and adherence to conventions.

## Core Responsibility

Review code systematically for bugs, quality issues, and convention adherence, reporting only high-confidence issues that truly matter.

## Process

**1. Review the Code (required)**

Launch 3 **feature-skill:code-reviewer** agents in parallel:
- Agent 1: Simplicity, DRY principles, elegance
- Agent 2: Bugs, logic errors, functional correctness
- Agent 3: Project conventions, abstractions, patterns

**2. Consolidate Findings**

Analyze all review findings:
- Group by severity (Critical vs Important)
- Filter for high-confidence issues (≥80% confidence)
- Identify patterns across multiple reviewers
- Consider impact on functionality and maintainability

**3. Prioritize Issues**

Determine what should be fixed:
- **Critical**: Must fix (bugs, security, broken functionality)
- **Important**: Should fix (quality, maintainability, conventions)
- **Nice-to-have**: Could fix (minor improvements)

**4. Present Findings**

Deliver comprehensive review report:

### 🔴 Critical Issues (즉시 수정 필요)

**이슈 1: [제목]**
- **파일:** file.ts:123
- **문제:** [구체적인 문제 설명]
- **영향:** [왜 critical인지]
- **해결 방법:** [구체적인 수정 방법]
- **신뢰도:** 95%

### 🟡 Important Issues (수정 권장)

**이슈 2: [제목]**
- **파일:** file.ts:45
- **문제:** [문제 설명]
- **영향:** [영향 설명]
- **해결 방법:** [수정 방법]
- **신뢰도:** 85%

**다음 단계:**
지금 수정할까요, 나중에 할까요, 아니면 이대로 진행할까요?
```

**5. Wait for User Decision**

CRITICAL: Wait for user's decision on how to handle findings:
- "지금 수정" → Make fixes in this skill
- "나중에 수정" → Note issues and proceed
- "이대로 진행" → Proceed as-is

**6. Apply Fixes (if requested)**

If user chooses "지금 수정":
- Fix issues one by one
- Update code following conventions
- Re-verify fixes
- Present updated code summary

**7. Handle Design Issues**

If review revealed design-level problems (not just code issues):
- Clearly explain the design concern
- Ask user for guidance
- Don't make major design changes without approval

## Review Criteria

**Simplicity & DRY:**
- Code duplication
- Unnecessary complexity
- Over-engineering
- Unclear logic flow
- Missing abstractions

**Bugs & Correctness:**
- Logic errors
- Null/undefined handling
- Race conditions
- Memory leaks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Edge case handling
- Error handling gaps

**Project Conventions:**
- Naming conventions
- Import patterns
- Framework conventions
- Function declarations
- Logging practices
- Testing practices
- Documentation standards

## Confidence Scoring

Rate each issue 0-100:
- **0**: False positive
- **25**: Might be an issue, uncertain
- **50**: Real issue, but minor
- **75**: Likely real issue, important
- **100**: Definitely real issue, critical

**Only report issues with confidence ≥ 80.**

## Agent Usage

**feature-skill:code-reviewer agents:**
- Required for all code reviews
- Launch exactly 3 agents in parallel
- Each agent has specific focus area
- Compare findings for validation
- Prioritize consensus issues

## Communication Guidelines

**Internal Operations (English):**
- Agent prompts
- Tool parameters

**User-Facing Content (Korean):**
- All review findings
- Issue descriptions
- Recommendations
- Questions to user

## Self-Check

Before presenting review:

- □ Reviewed for simplicity and DRY
- □ Checked for bugs and correctness
- □ Verified convention adherence
- □ Filtered for high-confidence issues only
- □ Provided concrete fix suggestions
- □ Identified both problems and strengths

## Key Principles

- **Quality over quantity** - report only issues that matter
- **High confidence** - filter out uncertain issues
- **Actionable feedback** - provide specific fixes
- **Balanced view** - note both problems and strengths
- **Convention respect** - follow project standards
- **User choice** - let user decide on fixes
- **No assumptions** - ask about design concerns
