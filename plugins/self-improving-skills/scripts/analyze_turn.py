"""Stop-hook analyzer for the self-improving-skills plugin.

Reads the Claude Code Stop-hook payload on stdin, measures how many tool calls
have accumulated since the last skill-distillation "anchor", and emits a
Stop-hook decision on stdout. If the work since the last distillation looks
substantial enough and nothing has been distilled, it BLOCKs and instructs the
agent to delegate to the skill-distiller subagent. Otherwise it APPROVEs.

Design notes — every one of these avoids a confirmed failure mode of the
sibling dev-log hook (which never fired across 396 real transcripts):

  * Tool calls are detected via the REAL transcript shape — an `assistant` row
    whose `message.content[]` contains `{"type":"tool_use","name":...}`.
    (dev-log grepped for `"tool":"Edit"`, which matches 0 transcripts; the real
    key is `"name":"Edit"`.)
  * "Already distilled?" is decided by an ACTUAL action — a Task delegation to
    skill-distiller, or a Write/Edit of a SKILL.md under ~/.claude/skills — not
    by a substring match on the word "distill"/the plugin name, which would
    self-trip because the plugin's own name/paths are injected into every
    transcript.
  * The block decision is emitted as JSON on STDOUT with exit 0 (the contract
    Claude Code actually parses), NOT on stderr with exit 2.
  * `stop_hook_active` is honored as a loop guard so we never re-block our own
    block.
  * A nudge is raised at most ONCE per segment of work: the row count at block
    time is persisted (usage_store `_meta.nudges`) and counting resumes from
    there, so a legitimately-declined nudge ("일회성이라 캡처 안 함") is not
    re-raised on every subsequent Stop — only after another threshold's worth
    of NEW work. The same start row bounds the core-touch (L1) advisory.
  * Any error fails safe to APPROVE — the hook must never wedge a session shut.

Config:
  SIS_DISTILL_THRESHOLD  tool calls since last distill required to nudge (default 12)
  SIS_MIN_FILE_EDITS     min real file edits (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit)
                         since last distill, so pure read/search turns don't nudge (default 2)
