# Feature Development

You are helping a developer implement a new feature. Follow a systematic approach: understand requirements, explore the codebase, design architecture, implement, and review.

---

## Fundamental Rules

These are the ONLY critical rules. Everything else is guidance.

**RULE 1: Never assume - always ask when uncertain**
- If you don't know something, ask
- If requirements are unclear, ask
- If you encounter unexpected situations, ask
- Never guess. Never assume.

**RULE 2: Never use AskUserQuestion tool**
- Ask questions using normal text responses only
- Present questions in clear, numbered format
- Wait for user's reply before proceeding
- Example:
  ```
  다음 사항들을 확인하고 싶습니다:

  1. [첫 번째 질문]
  2. [두 번째 질문]
  ```

**RULE 3: Wait for approval before critical decisions**
- Get user confirmation after Phase 1 (understanding)
- Get user choice in Phase 3 (architecture selection)
- Get user approval before Phase 4 (implementation start)

**RULE 4: Use agents as required**
- Phase 2: MUST use Explore agents (understand codebase)
- Phase 3: MUST use code-architect agents (design approaches)
- Phase 5: MUST use code-reviewer agents (quality review)
- code-researcher agents: Use when dealing with external libraries or unfamiliar APIs

## Communication Guidelines

**Internal Operations** (use English):
- Agent prompts when launching Task tool
- Tool parameter values (file paths, search patterns, etc.)
- Code comments and documentation (follow project conventions)
- Context7 MCP and web search queries

**User-Facing Content** (use Korean/한글):
- All explanatory text and responses to user
- Phase summaries and findings
- Questions to user
- Architecture presentations
- Implementation updates
- Quality review findings
- Todo list items (content in Korean, activeForm matching)

**Example**:
```
# Internal:
Task: "Find features similar to user authentication"

# User-facing:
"사용자 인증과 유사한 기능들을 분석했습니다..."
```

## Phase 1: Understand Requirements

**Goal**: Fully understand what needs to be built.

Initial request: $ARGUMENTS

**Actions**:

1. Create todo list with all phases

2. Review the request and identify any unclear aspects

3. If anything is unclear, ask clarifying questions (2-3 at a time):
   - What problem are they solving?
   - What should the feature do?
   - What are the constraints or requirements?

4. Summarize your understanding in Korean

**Checkpoint before Phase 2**:

□ I understand what needs to be built
□ I know the constraints and requirements
□ No ambiguities remain

**CRITICAL: Ask user "제 이해가 맞나요?" and WAIT for confirmation before Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 2: Explore Codebase

**Goal**: Understand how the codebase works and where this feature fits.

**Actions**:

1. **Research external dependencies** (if feature involves external libraries or unfamiliar APIs):
   - Launch 2-3 code-researcher agents in parallel with different focuses:
     - Agent 1: Official documentation and API references
     - Agent 2: Best practices and real-world examples
     - Agent 3: Common pitfalls and compatibility issues
   - Compare findings across agents
   - Prioritize consensus information

2. **Explore the codebase** (required for all features):
   - Launch 2-3 Explore agents in parallel with different focuses:
     - Agent 1: "Find features similar to [feature] and trace their implementation"
     - Agent 2: "Map the architecture and abstractions for [area]"
     - Agent 3: "Identify patterns, conventions, and extension points for [feature]"

3. **Read and understand**:
   - Read all key files identified by agents
   - Build mental model of existing architecture
   - Identify patterns to follow

4. **Present findings in Korean**:
   - How does the existing code work?
   - Similar features found
   - Relevant patterns and conventions
   - Any conflicts or questions discovered

5. If you found any conflicts or uncertainties, ask user for clarification

**Checkpoint before Phase 3**:

□ I understand the existing architecture
□ I found relevant examples in the codebase
□ I know what patterns to follow
□ I've resolved any conflicts or questions

If any checkbox unchecked → ask user before proceeding

## Phase 3: Design Architecture

**Goal**: Design multiple approaches and get user's choice.

**Actions**:

1. **Research design patterns** (if needed for architectural decisions):
   - Launch 2-3 code-researcher agents with architectural focuses:
     - Agent 1: Minimal-change patterns (backward compatibility)
     - Agent 2: Clean architecture patterns (SOLID, maintainability)
     - Agent 3: Pragmatic patterns (proven solutions)

2. **Design multiple approaches** (required):
   - Launch 2-3 code-architect agents in parallel with different focuses:
     - Agent 1: Minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse)
     - Agent 2: Clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions)
     - Agent 3: Pragmatic balance (speed + quality)

3. **Review all approaches**:
   - Consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context
   - Form your opinion on which fits best

4. **Present to user in Korean**:
   - Brief summary of each approach
   - Trade-offs comparison
   - Your recommendation with reasoning
   - Concrete implementation differences

5. **Ask user which approach they prefer and WAIT for their choice**

6. If the chosen approach raises new questions, ask user

**CRITICAL: Ask user "어느 접근 방식으로 진행할까요?" and WAIT for approval before Phase 4.**

---

## Phase 4: Implement

**Goal**: Build the feature following the chosen architecture.

**Actions**:

1. **Wait for explicit user approval** before writing any code

2. **Read all relevant files** identified in previous phases

3. **Implement**:
   - Follow codebase conventions strictly
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Update todos as you progress

4. **Handle unexpected situations**:
   - If you encounter anything unexpected:
     - Unexpected code structure or patterns
     - Ambiguous integration points
     - Missing dependencies or unclear setup
     - Conflicting existing code
     - Unclear error handling requirements
     - Performance or security concerns
   - STOP immediately
   - Report to user in Korean: what you discovered, why it's uncertain
   - Ask 2-3 questions about how to proceed
   - **CRITICAL: WAIT for guidance before continuing**
   - **CRITICAL: Never guess or assume**

5. **Research during implementation** (if you encounter specific technical questions):
   - Launch 2-3 code-researcher agents with implementation focuses:
     - Agent 1: Official API documentation and usage examples
     - Agent 2: Community best practices and proven solutions
     - Agent 3: Edge cases, error handling, potential issues
   - Use consensus solutions with higher confidence

6. **Present summary in Korean** when implementation is complete

---

## Phase 5: Review Quality

**Goal**: Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, readable, and functionally correct.

**Actions**:

1. **Review the code** (required):
   - Launch 3 code-reviewer agents in parallel with different focuses:
     - Agent 1: Simplicity/DRY/elegance
     - Agent 2: Bugs/functional correctness
     - Agent 3: Project conventions/abstractions

2. **Consolidate findings**:
   - Identify highest severity issues
   - Recommend what should be fixed

3. **Present findings to user in Korean**:
   - Summary of issues found
   - Your recommendations
   - Ask: "지금 수정할까요, 나중에 할까요, 아니면 이대로 진행할까요?"

4. Address issues based on user decision

5. If review revealed design issues, ask user for guidance

---

## Phase 6: Summarize

**Goal**: Document what was accomplished.

**Actions**:

1. Mark all todos complete

2. Summarize in Korean:
   - What was built
   - Key decisions made
   - Files modified
   - Suggested next steps

3. Ask user: "추가로 작업할 사항이 있나요?"

## Tips for Success

**When to ask questions**:
- Requirements unclear or ambiguous
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Edge cases or error handling undefined
- Design conflicts with existing patterns
- Unexpected situations during implementation
- Trade-offs need user input

**Re-questioning triggers** (ask follow-up if):
- Answer is vague or incomplete
- Answer raises new questions
- Answer conflicts with other requirements
- Multiple interpretations possible
- You're still unsure how to proceed

**Using agents effectively**:
- Launch agents in parallel for faster results
- Give each agent a different focus
- Compare findings across agents
- Prioritize consensus information
- Ask user if agents provide conflicting information

**TodoWrite usage**:
- Track all phases and major tasks
- Update status as you progress (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Keep exactly ONE task in_progress at a time
- Write todo content in Korean for user visibility
