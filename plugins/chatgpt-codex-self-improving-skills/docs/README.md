# Codex Self Improvement

This plugin implements a Hermes-inspired learning loop for Codex:

- `PostToolUse` records tool telemetry, counts tool iterations toward the
  review trigger, and watches for skill edits that bypassed the skill manager
  (snapshot diff — a direct shell edit gets validated, its patch telemetry
  repaired, and a post-hoc checkpoint backup).
- `Stop` requests a self-improvement continuation by default when a trigger
  fires. Set `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_AUTO=0` to opt out. The interval
  trigger counts accumulated tool iterations (default 10,
  `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_INTERVAL`) — not Stop turns — and real skill work
  (create/patch/write through the manager) resets the counter. The signal
  regex matches only explicit corrective phrasings ("next time", "다음부터",
  "틀렸" …), and a transcript signal is consumed once seen so the same old
  message never re-fires the review. `$skill-name` mentions in new transcript
  rows are attributed to that skill's use count.
- `SessionStart` injects a tiny status note, plus an interval-gated curator
  nudge: when the last curate pass is older than
  `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CURATE_INTERVAL_DAYS` (default 7) and at least
  `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CURATE_MIN_SKILLS` (default 8) skills are tracked, a
  dry-run curate runs in-process and a one-line candidate summary is injected.
  First sight only seeds the clock (never curates right after install).
- Skills guide review and curator workflows. The review skill follows the
  Hermes ladder: patch the skill that was in play > extend an existing skill >
  embed the corrected preference > create new (last resort). "Nothing to
  save." is a real option, but not the default.
- A local MCP/CLI skill manager creates backups, tracks usage (viewing a
  skill counts as a use — loading is behavioural intent), pins important
  skills, archives stale skills (timestamp-suffixed on collision), restores
  archived skills, lists/restores/prunes backups (rollback is itself
  undoable), and runs an advisory security scan (secrets / prompt injection /
  invisible unicode / local paths — findings never block a local write).
- New skills are provenance-stamped in frontmatter
  (`metadata.provenance: self-improving-skills`), so agent-created skills
  stay curation-eligible even if the usage sidecar is lost or the skill moves
  machines. Every curate run persists a report under the data dir's
  `logs/curator/<utc>/`.

## Installation

Add the repository's Codex marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add samton-inc/samton-plugins
codex plugin add chatgpt-codex-self-improving-skills@samton-plugins
```

For an existing installation, refresh the marketplace and reinstall the plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade samton-plugins
codex plugin add chatgpt-codex-self-improving-skills@samton-plugins
```

After installing or upgrading, CLI users should start a new Codex task. Desktop
users should quit and reopen the app, then start a new task so the new plugin
package and hooks are loaded.

The default Stop hook automatically continues into a short review after an
explicit correction signal or the configured tool-iteration threshold. To
disable automatic continuation for a shell-launched Codex process:

```bash
export CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_AUTO=0
```

For the desktop app, set the value persistently in `~/.codex/config.toml`
(merge it into an existing table instead of declaring the table twice):

```toml
[shell_environment_policy.set]
CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_AUTO = "0"
```

An `export` made after the desktop app has started does not change that
already-running app's environment.

State is stored in `PLUGIN_DATA` when Codex provides it. Installed MCP/CLI
processes derive the same official directory from their cache path:
`~/.codex/plugins/data/<plugin>-<marketplace>`. A source checkout that has
neither value keeps the legacy `~/.self-improving-skills` fallback.

By default, new skills created through the manager are written to
`~/.codex/skills`. The manager can also read existing user skills from
`~/.agents/skills` for compatibility, and `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CREATE_ROOT`
can override the create location.

## Read-before-write guard

Patching or overwriting an EXISTING skill file requires reading it first
(Hermes rule: edit what you actually saw, not what you remember):

- **MCP**: `codex_skill_view` registers the resolved file path; `codex_skill_patch`
  and `codex_skill_write_file` reject unviewed existing targets. Creating a
  new file is exempt. Unlike Hermes there is no background-review origin to
  scope the guard to (the Stop hook continues the same session), so the guard
  applies to the whole MCP session unconditionally.
- **CLI**: the process dies between calls, so the CLI approximates with the
  skill's `last_viewed_at` (within 30 minutes, skill-level). Humans can pass
  `--force-unviewed`.

## Environment variables

| variable | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_AUTO` | on | Stop-hook auto-continue into the review pass; set any explicit non-truthy value such as `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` to disable |
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_INTERVAL` | `10` | tool iterations since the last review/skill-work that trigger the interval review (0 disables) |
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CURATE_INTERVAL_DAYS` | `7` | days between SessionStart curator nudges |
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CURATE_MIN_SKILLS` | `8` | tracked-skill count below which the curator nudge stays silent |
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_SKILL_ROOTS` | (auto) | override the skill root search list |
| `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_CREATE_ROOT` | `~/.codex/skills` | where new skills are created |

## Data migration

The CLI can import older stores without deleting them. The command is a
read-only dry-run unless `--apply` is present. When running the CLI from a
source checkout, pass the installed marketplace's canonical data directory
explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/skill_manager_cli.py migrate-data --source ~/.self-improving-skills --target ~/.codex/plugins/data/chatgpt-codex-self-improving-skills-samton-plugins
python3 scripts/skill_manager_cli.py migrate-data --source ~/.self-improving-skills --target ~/.codex/plugins/data/chatgpt-codex-self-improving-skills-samton-plugins --apply
```

These examples assume the default Codex home (`~/.codex`). If Codex uses a
custom home, replace that prefix with the active Codex home path.

An installed-cache copy derives that same target automatically, so
`--target` can be omitted there. Stop other Codex processes that still use the
legacy source before applying. The migration verifies that the source stayed
stable while it was snapshotted and aborts before importing active data if it
detects a concurrent change.

Before applying, it snapshots both source and target under a sibling
`<target>-migration-backups/` directory. Skill usage metadata is merged
conservatively, live target tool/session counters stay authoritative, backup
content is deduplicated, and historical logs/signals/state are preserved under
`imports/` instead of being replayed into live state. Re-running the same
import is idempotent.

## MCP server startup contract

`.mcp.json` starts the skill manager with `cwd: "."` (the plugin root), a
relative script path, and an allowlist of documented `CODEX_SELF_IMPROVE_*`
settings. The server resolves the plugin root from `PLUGIN_ROOT` when Codex
provides it, else from its own `__file__` location, and derives Codex's
writable plugin-data directory from an installed cache path when
`PLUGIN_DATA` is absent. `serverInfo.version` is read from
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` at initialize time (a hardcoded version literal
drifted from the manifest once; never reintroduce one).

## Recommended reasoning effort

The review and curator passes inherit the Codex session's
`model_reasoning_effort` (`~/.codex/config.toml`; codex CLI 0.144+ accepts
`minimal`–`xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`):

- Day-to-day post-turn reviews: the default (`medium`) is enough.
- Large consolidation passes (`$codex-skill-curator` over many skills):
  `high`–`xhigh` is worth it.
- `ultra` is not just "more reasoning": it enables proactive multi-agent
  behaviour and can hit transient "Selected model is at capacity" errors —
  one retry usually clears them. Don't leave it on for routine passes.

Per-skill effort pinning in `agents/openai.yaml` is NOT supported by the
current schema (interface/dependencies/policy only) — don't add model fields
there.
